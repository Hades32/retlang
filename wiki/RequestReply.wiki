In general, request reply is not recommended. With asynchronous messaging it is typically better to use purely asynchronous communication. However, there are times when request/reply is the best option.

= Example =

{{{
IProcessContext context = ... 

IRequestReply<string> req = context.SendRequest<string>("my.topic", "data");

string reply = req.Receive(5000).Message;

}}}
