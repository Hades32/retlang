In general, request reply is not recommended. With asynchronous messaging it is typically better to use purely asynchronous communication. However, there are times when request/reply is the best option.

=== Request ===

{{{
IProcessContext context = ... 

IRequestReply<string> req = context.SendRequest<string>("my.topic", "data");

string reply = req.Receive(5000).Message;

}}}

=== Reply ===

{{{
IProcessContext context = ...
OnMessage<string> onMsg = delegate(IMessageHeader header, string msg) 
{ 
  context2.Publish(header.ReplyTo, "reply to: " + msg); 
};
context2.Subscribe(new TopicEquals("my.topic"), onMsg);

}}}
