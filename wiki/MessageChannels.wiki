= Introduction =

Channels were introduced in 0.3.0.0 as a lighter weight, higher performance alternative to context messaging with topics.

== Features ==
  * Cheap to create - Simple objects that can be used and discarded
  * Fully Typed
  * High Performance - Millions of messages per second

== Basic Pub/Sub ==

This test creates a pool based queue then subscribes it to a channel.
