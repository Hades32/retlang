= Creating Topics =

Any .NET object can be a publishable topic. 

== Unique Topics ==
Created a completely unique topic is just a matter of instantiating an object. The publisher and any subscribers will need a reference to this object for pub/sub.
{{{
object uniqueTopic = new object();
}}}

== String Topics ==
String topics are easy to use and don't require the sharing of objects. This method should be familiar to anyone that has JMS.

{{{
string myTopic = "system.topic"
}}}

= Subscribing =

== TopicMatcher ==
A topic matcher simply matches topics based on equality.
{{{
TopicMatcher matcher = new TopicMatcher("my.topic");
}}}

== Topic Selector ==
The topic selector matches topics based upon a delegate.
{{{
IsMatch selector = delegate(object obj){ return true; }
TopicSelector topicSelector = new TopicSelector(selector);
}}}
